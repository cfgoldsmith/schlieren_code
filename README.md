# shock_code
This directory contains our cantera model for laser schlieren experiments.
The best plan to use the Jupyter Notebooks. The notebook for isopentyl-nitrite has some examples on how to mimic the output from Bilbo. The notebook for npropyl-nitrite has examples on parsing shock.rho, shock.exp, etc.
